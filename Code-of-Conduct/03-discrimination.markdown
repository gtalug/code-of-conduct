## Discrimination

We are dedicated to creating and preserving an inclusive, nondiscriminatory
environment, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

Accessibility is an important part of being inclusive. We favor accessibility,
and where accessibility issues are identified, we strive to document and 
communicate them.  When accessible alternatives to any tools or venues are 
brought to our attention, we investigate them to the best of our ability.
