## Discrimination

We are dedicated to creating and preserving an inclusive, nondiscriminatory environment, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

Accessibility is an important part of being inclusive. We favor accessible venues, try to document accessibility issues and welcome suggestions for accessible alternatives to any non-accessible venue.
