## Harassment

We are dedicated to provide a harassment-free community for everyone.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation,
stalking, following, unwanted photography or recording, sustained disruption of
talks or other events, unconsensual deliberate physical contact, and unwelcome
sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, suspect that someone else is being harassed, or have
learned of harassment at a past event, please contact an organizer or a member
of the executive as soon as possible. We strive to build a positive community.
